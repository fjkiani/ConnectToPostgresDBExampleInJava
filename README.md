# ConnectToPostgresDBExampleInJava

This is an example of how to connect to a postgres database and retrieve some table data in Java

Make sure to have the postgres jdbc jar file installed and downloaded here: https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html

I also included sample SQL statments to create a sample table and insert into table in the SRC folder.
